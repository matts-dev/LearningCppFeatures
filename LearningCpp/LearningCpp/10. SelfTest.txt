/*VECTOR*/
//Self test concepts:
//declare a vector
//set the space of the underlying array
//set the accessable portion of the array
//get the size of the array
//assign something to every active index of the array
//increase the size of an array by adding something
//access elements using .at()
//access elements using[]
//obtain vectors start and end iterators (without using auto)
//insert an element in the middle of an array									(hint: iterators)
//what happened to vector size?
//erase an element from the middle of the
//what happened to vector size?
//loop through a vector using an iterator
//-bonus: loop through using size()
//clear the array
//-using resize()
//-using .clear()
//clear() does what to contained objects?
//clear calls destructor on stack objects, but does not call delete on heap objects
//use a for-each to print the vector
//init pointer vector with {}
//old vectors (before cpp11) - init these
//access teh front of an array
//access the back of an array



/*String*/
//initialize string using "";
//get the memory size of a string value		(sizeof)
//how is string memory handled internall? (like vectors)
//get the size of a string (not memory, but internal indeces)
//get the length of a string. is this the same thing as size()?
//concatenate two strings
//use comparison operators to test which (of two strings) comes first lexographically
//are stl strings mutalble?			<yes>
//obtain a string iterator
//use iterator to insert a char
//use iterator to erase a sequence of chars (its mutable, so it is okay)
//use iterator to erase everything after a specific index
//can the "" assignment *only* be during initialization? 		<no>
//replace range of chars within a string, with a new string
//get a substring
//what is the second argument in the substr method? <number of elements>
//find a sequence within a string
//	what does find return?		<int location>
//what is the error if char or string cannot be found?	<returns 
//find a sequence within a string, but from the end (using an easy method without iterators)
//use find from a specific index of the string 	
//Parse to integers using stringstreams
//possible ways to load a string into stringstream?
//parse doubles from a stringstream



/*iostream - cout*/
//pass arguments/modifiers to cout
//what is a modifier/manipulator?
// what is the modifier to cout to print hex integers?
// what is hte modifier to print oct numbers?
// what is the modifier to print scientific?
// what is the modifier to set the precision?
// what is the include if you try to setprecision without properly setting up? #include<manip>
// how to reset the float outputs of cout?     cout.unset(ios_base::floatfield)
// FORMATING
// how ot set hte width?
// how to make right/left justified?
// when does the target string enter couter when using the baove two manipulators? <at the end>
// how to set the fill of the width (ie change from default whitespace)
// how ot set cout? is it straightfoward?



/*iostream - cin*/
//self test cin
//using cin, can you pass an entire string into it?
//				no, cin deliminates by spaces, thus it will not store the entire string
//what happens when you attempt to load a string containig spaces into cin? there are remaining words in the buffer
//how to clear cins buffer?			cin.ignore(,)
//what are the arguments of cin.ignore?			(size, and stop point)
//what arguments should you use to clear a line at a time?			<numeric_limits<streamsize::max()>, '\n'>
//what must you include toget the max limit? //#include<limits> //for numeric limits with cin

//make cin to take an entire string? 				getline(char buffer and sizeof)
//what are the arguments of cin.getline(,)?			char[] and sizeof the array

//what happens if you enter a line too big for the buffer of cingetline?
// how to clear the error?			cin.clear()
// should you clear the buffer?		yes,   cin.ignore(numeric_limits(streamsize::max()), '\n'
// should you always include '\n' in the cin.ignore(,) buffer clear? <YES, otherwise cin seems to will ignore further calls>

// another good aproach for getting a line? independent of cin?
// std::getline(), how is it different from cin.getline()?			<it accepts streams (first arg), then location (second arg)>
//					note, std::getline(stream, container) can save in strings, not just char buffers
// can this getline be used with stringstrams? <YES>
//




/*iostream - files*/
//self test
//create an ostream for a filename
//check if file sucessfully opened
//insert data into ostream (file)
//close ostream
//create an istream for a filename
//check if file opened
//check if file has more to read
//extract data
//save data
//close istream
//advanced
//open an ostream that will delete  the file if it exists			<truncate>
//find the first character of a file								<seekp(0, ios::beg)>		//p for put
//open a istream for a file
//after reading data, go back to beginning of ifle 					<seekg(0, ios::beg)>		//g for get



/*iterators*/
//self test
//5 types of iterators: Forward, Bidirectional, Random Access, Input, Output
//get an iterator from a vector<int>
//set the iterator to the begining of the vector container
//get an iterator for the end of the vector container
//use the iterators to loop through the container (careful as to the end)
//use pointer arthimetic on an iterator
//use random access on an iterator
//get a reverse iterator
//increment down the container using reverser iterators 




/*list*/




/*pair*/
//make a pair that can hold a string and a double
//what must you include for pair?



/*set*/
//concept set test questions
//create a set
//insert elements into a set
//find elements in a set
//erase element in set if it was found  - erase requires iterator, so you can't erase non-existent 
//check if an insert was sucessful
//		-a pair is returned: first element = iterator, second element = boolean of status of insert
//		-iterator points to either new element inserted, or the element that was identical to it (and prevented it from being inserted)
// multisets exist - their insert just returns an iterator to the inserted element (which is the last element)



/*map*/
//self test Maps
//create a map of strings and strings used to convert from english to spansih colors
//insert an element to the map using the .insert function and brackets {,}
//insert an element to the map using the .insert function and a std::pair variable
//insert an element using the [] notation
//can maps be accessed backwards (using value to get key?)					<no, they cannot>
//Access an element using .at()				<returns value for key>
//Access an element using .find()			<returns a pair>
//Access an element using []				<returns value for key>
//Erase an element passing an iterator and using .find to get the iterator()
//erase an element passing a key
//use the erase method within an if statements condition
//iterator through a map using the STL iterators (get them directly from map)

//? What happens if you try to insert an pair for which a key already exists?	<it returns an error pair, first is the value already at the key,second is bool as in regards to successful insertion>
//? What happens if you successfully insert a pair using insert?				< returns (pair<map<string, string>::iterator, bool>), ie{*{key, value}, (bool success)} is what is returned, first is an iterator>
//? What happens if you try to access something using [] that doesn't exist?	<a key will be created [key], its value will be set to a default value (an emptry string in this case)>
//? What happens if you make a key using [key] but don't set a value and no-default constructor exists for the object?
//? What does .erase return?			<returns number of elements erased>



/*deques*/
//deque - double ended queue
//create a deque
// push values to front of deque
// push values to back of deque
// loop through deque with for-each
// loop through deque with forward iterator
// loop through deque with reverse iterator 



/*exceptions*/
//self test
//write an exception call that must be constructed with a string arguement
//throw an exception
//throw a specific exception object 
//catch differnt type of exceptions
//how to write xception specification
//what does the specification throw() do?
//Should exception specifications be written?


/*string stream*/




/*stacks*/




/*queues*/
//self test
//queue
//create a default queue
//create a queue from a lst
//get the first element of a que
//release first element of the que
//loop through a queue (ie getting rid of the front)
