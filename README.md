# LearningCppFeatures
I decided to go through the major topics in c++11 and practice coding them in visual
studio (the environment I program my private repo games). Before starting this project, I was
programming with c++, but I had never formally tested many features of the
language (such as using function pointers for member functions). So, during the summer of 2016 
I decided to start this repo and re-visit everything in c++ from the ground up,
including new stuff such as threads, smart pointers, and move semantics. As I Learn and 
test new things in c++, I will probably come back to this project and add them. 
Feel free to use it as a reference and test c++/
